This application has been designed to expose backend endpoints for our frontend application to consume. The project utilizes a service-oriented architecture, enabling the frontend to consume both this API and our AWS S3-specific API. This setup allows users to organize their projects and tasks within a single application.

[Frontend Code Repository](https://github.com/analog-m4/analog_fe)

Our Applications:
- Backend: [Heroku](https://analog-be-18680af1ea7c.herokuapp.com/)
- S3 Microservice: [Heroku](https://s3-direct-upload-microservice-a2d4cfd91078.herokuapp.com/)
- Frontend: [Vercel](https://analog-fe.vercel.app/)

This project served as our group's capstone, fulfilling the graduation requirements for the Turing School of Software and Design. For further information on Capstone requirements, please visit: [Capstone Project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/)
