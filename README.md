I will do this later if no one else wants to do the pitch.  

## Application Details

This application has been designed to be the user interface.  This project utilizes service-oriented architecture, which allows this application to consume endpoints from both the backend repository and the AWS S3-specific repository.

[Backend Code Repository](https://github.com/analog-m4/analog_be)

Our Applications:
- Backend: [Heroku](https://analog-be-18680af1ea7c.herokuapp.com/)
- S3 Microservice: [Heroku](https://s3-direct-upload-microservice-a2d4cfd91078.herokuapp.com/)
- Frontend: [Vercel](https://analog-fe.vercel.app/)

This project served as our group's capstone, fulfilling the graduation requirements for the Turing School of Software and Design. For further information on Capstone requirements, please visit: [Capstone Project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone/)
